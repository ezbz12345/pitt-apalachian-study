title: "Asthma Exacerbations and Reproductive Outcomes Studies"
---

## What are we studying? 

We are studying the relationship between exposure to hydraulic fracturing in Southwest Pennsylvania and acute health conditions. The focus will be on: 1) asthma diagnoses and exacerbations; and 2) adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, in the following counties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Washington, and Westmoreland.

## Why is this research being done?

We hope that the outcome of this study will add to our knowledge of the association of acute health conditions and exposure to hydraulic fracturing. 

## How is this study being conducted?

Information on asthma diagnoses and exacerbations will be obtained from the Department of Bioinformatics’ Health Record Research Request (R3). R3 provides University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Clinical data to researchers. R3 is providing data on approximately 100,000 UPMC patients in the 8-county study area. Electronic medical records will include information on dates of visits, dates of admissions, and prescriptions related to asthma, as well as residence location at time of visit/prescription from 2011 to the present.
 
Birth information, including adverse outcomes, will be obtained from PADOH birth records from 2010-present. Of a priori interest are four birth outcomes: term (≥37 week) birth weight, preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), low 5-minute Apgar score (<7), and small for gestational age. We will collect covariate information from birth records, including gender of the child and mother’s age, maternal education level, pre-pregnancy weight, access to prenatal care, maternal smoking, diagnosis of gestational diabetes, use of WIC services, race, parity, and parents’ occupations.

## Confidentiality

Researchers will not receive any identifying information on participants. Any information gathered for this research study will be kept strictly confidential and information will be aggregated. 

## Who is paying for this study?

The studies on acute health outcomes are funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.
