## What are we studying? 

We are studying the relationship between environmental risk factors, such as unconventional natural gas development activities, and acute health conditions in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The focus will be on 1) asthma diagnoses and exacerbations; and 2) adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, in the following counties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Washington, and Westmoreland.

## Why is this research being done?

We hope that the outcome of this study will add to our knowledge of the association of acute health conditions and exposure to environmental risk factors, such as unconventional natural gas development activities. 

## How is this study being conducted?

We are not contacting anyone to participate in the studies of acute health conditions. All of the information that we need is already in existing records.

Information on asthma diagnoses and exacerbations will be obtained from a medical records data repository that provides clinical data to researchers. We will collect data on patients in the 8-county study area. The records will include information on dates of visits, dates of admissions, and prescriptions related to asthma, as well as residence location at time of visit/prescription from 2011 to the present.
 
Birth information will be obtained from Pennsylvania birth records from 2010 to the present. We are particularly interested in four birth outcomes: term (≥37 week) birth weight, preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), low 5-minute Apgar score (<7), and small for gestational age. We will collect other information from birth records including the baby’s gender, characteristics of the mother, her pregnancy, and residence location at time of birth.

## Confidentiality

Researchers will not receive any identifying information on participants. Any information gathered for this research study will be kept strictly confidential and information will be aggregated so that no individual can be identified. 

## Who is paying for this study?

The studies on acute health outcomes are funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.
