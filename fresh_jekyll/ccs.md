## What are we studying? 

We are studying how exposures to chemicals are potentially linked to childhood cancers.  Childhood cancer is the third-leading cause of death in US children, yet there are very few known risk factors. This study will consider some of the risks that may play a role. These risks include lifestyle behaviors, residential history (where people lived over time), family medical history, potential workplace exposures, and exposures to unconventional natural gas development activities and other industrial pollutants located in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

## Why is this research being done?

The purpose of this study is to look at possible risk factors for childhood cancers. We hope that the results of this study will help us identify risks of exposures to chemicals where people live and work and how those risks are potentially linked to childhood cancers in Southwestern Pennsylvania. We will specifically focus on finding out which  members from our Southwestern Pennsylvania communities are at high risk for developing childhood cancer potentially linked to chemical exposures and other non-chemical risks. This will help us develop ways to counter these risks.

## Who will be asked to participate in this research study?

We are recruiting a case group—families of children with cancer—to compare to a control group—families of children without cancer. 

Eligible participants will be contacted by the project office regarding participation in this study. 

For the case group, only parents will be asked to participate in this study if they have a child:
- Who was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Central Nervous System tumors, or Ewing’s/Bone cancer between 2010-2019
- Who was age 0-19 at the time of diagnosis
- Resided in one of the following Pennsylvania counties:
    - Allegheny County
    - Armstrong County
    - Beaver County
    - Butler County
    - Fayette County
    - Greene County
    - Washington County
    - Westmoreland County

For the control group, only parents will be asked to participate in this study. The participants in both groups will be matched on age, sex, race, and county.

## What will parents be asked to do?  

Participants will be asked to complete a 45-60 minute telephone interview about  individual, occupational (where they work), and environmental risk factors (e.g. potential chemical exposures where they live). Participants will be compensated for their time.

## Confidentiality

Any information provided for this research study will be kept strictly confidential. Information shared with others will be grouped and will protect participants so that no one outside of the study team can find out any personal information.

## Who is paying for this study?

The study is funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.
