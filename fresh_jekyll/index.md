The University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health is conducting three separate studies in Southwestern Pennsylvania focusing on personal, occupational, and environmental risk factors and the association with disease. A risk factor is an exposure or characteristic that puts you at greater risk for disease, (e.g., cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer). One study will exclusively investigate the relationship between these risk factors and the development of childhood cancers using recruited participants. The other two studies will replicate earlier work on acute health conditions, asthma and birth outcomes, using data from health records and registries.
