The University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health is conducting three separate studies in Southwestern Pennsylvania focusing on the risks of human exposures to chemicals that may hurt the health of community members where they live or where they work. 

The first study will focus on finding out how the risk of exposures to chemicals may be  linked to childhood cancers in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The second and third study will use data and information already available and focus on finding out if risk of exposures to chemicals are related to more cases of asthma and adverse birth outcomes in Southwestern Pennsylvania.
