### Evelyn O. Talbott, DrPH, MPH
Dr. Talbott is the Principal Investigator for this study. She is a Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. She has over 30+ years of experience studying the association of environmental and occupational risk factors and health outcomes. She and Dr Youk, conducted the long-term 20+ year mortality and cancer incidence follow-up of residents living within five miles of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. From 2005-2014, Dr Talbott was the director of one of five CDC Academic Centers of Excellence in Environmental Public Health Tracking, and leads the Environmental Epidemiology graduate program. She has worked extensively with PADOH on several cancer cluster investigations (Tranguch gasoline spill), Shalercrest childhood cancer investigation and CDC –PADOH “Asthma and air pollution in PA study” in collaboration with the PA DOH Tracking Program. Her areas of expertise include the investigation of short and long-term effects of air pollution on asthma exacerbations, heart disease and cancer. She has published over 200 peer reviewed articles and chapters based on her work. Dr. Talbott has conducted numerous community-based health studies and works closely with the medical and public health community throughout Pennsylvania.

### Jeanine Buchanich, PhD, MEd, MPH 
Dr. Buchanich serves as Co-Principal Investigator on the project and directs the retrospective cohort studies, including the exposure assessment related to hydraulic fracking and the risk of asthma and adverse birth outcomes. She is a Research Associate Professor of Biostatistics and the Director of the Center for Occupational Biostatistics and Epidemiology. Dr. Buchanich more than 25 years’ experience with large occupational and environmental cohort studies. She has extensive expertise in data management and design, particularly with occupational and environmental case-control studies. She previously studied the health of communities in WVA in relationship to underground and to mountaintop coal mining, and morbidity and mortality differences in the health of communities living near underground versus surface coal mining. She was the Principal Investigator for a PADOH/ATSDR study of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including polycythemia vera, in Eastern Pennsylvania. Dr. Buchanich has worked extensively with the PADOH on the extent of the opioid crisis in Pennsylvania. She currently leads the evaluation of the PADOH CDC-Sponsored Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) activities. She has published numerous papers on the sociodemographic and economic risk factors related to the opioid epidemic in the US and is nationally and internationally known for her work in analyzing the trends of this epidemic.

### Jian-Min Yuan, MD, PhD 
Dr. Yuan is a Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health and Associate Director for Cancer Control and Population Science and Co-Leader of the Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. Dr. Yuan has more than 35 years of research experience in cancer epidemiology with a research focus on the roles of environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, and their interaction in the development of cancers. Dr. Yuan has been collaborating with Dr. Talbott studying early life exposures on the risk of childhood cancer. His research work has resulted in over 400 peer-reviewed publications. He will act as a liaison between the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and the Graduate School of Public Health to provide insight and direction for the successful completion of the childhood case-control study. Dr. Yuan will participate in the design of the case-control study of the childhood cancer in western Pennsylvania, the development and implementation of the study protocol, and the interpretation of the results.

### James Fabisiak, PhD
Dr. Fabisiak attended Syracuse University (BS) and Cornell University (MS) prior to receiving his Ph.D. in Pharmacology at the Pennsylvania State University School of Medicine at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. He went on to post-doctoral training at the University of Vermont and was the recipient of a Parker B. Francis Fellowship in Pulmonary Biology and Respiratory Medicine. He then went to the University of Pittsburgh and spent some time in the Div. of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine and the Dept. of Pharmacology before settling into the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health. He primarily considers himself a mechanistic toxicologist studying the cellular and molecular responses of injury, inflammation, repair and pathologic remodeling in the lung following environmental insult. He has received funding from the NIH, EPA and other sources with contributed to over 50 peer-reviewed publications. More recently he has “expanded his portfolio” to include more public health community-based activities such as studying public health risks associated with point source air pollution, unconventional natural gas drilling and marine oil spills. He is an author of several PRETA reports examining community air quality issues in Southwest PA. More information can be found on his [faculty website](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/james-p-fabisiak).

### Sally Wenzel, MD
Dr. Wenzel is Chair of the Dept of Environmental and Occupational Health and Director of the University of Pittsburgh Asthma and Environmental Lung Health Institute at UPMC. She has had a lifelong passion of determining the genetic and environmental factors which contribute to both the development of asthma and its severity. Dr. Wenzel will provide insight and guidance on the relationship of UNGD to development of asthma and asthma exacerbations. 

### Ada Youk, PhD 
Dr. Youk is an Associate Professor in Biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh and Senior Biostatistician in the Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion (CHERP) Biostatistics and Informatics Core at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System. She as roles as Principal Investigator, Co-Investigator, and Lead Biostatistician with primary responsibility for statistical integrity, including conceptualization, design, and grant development, recruitment/data collection, monitoring, analysis, reporting, and manuscript preparation.  Dr. Youk has expertise in regression modelling, longitudinal data analysis, health disparities, clinical research, and occupational and environmental epidemiology. She has extensive experience with analyzing data from clinical research projects, analyzing big data from large administrative data systems as well as the analysis of large, longitudinal, prospective epidemiology studies which primarily involve time to event modeling and mixed effects modeling. She teaches courses in introductory biostatistics, applied regression analysis, scientific communication skills, mathematical methods for statistics, and mixed models in the Graduate School of Public Health.
