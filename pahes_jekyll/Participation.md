## The Study Has Two Parts  

### Part 1: Survey
You will be asked to participate in a 30-minute telephone or web-based interview consisting of questions about where you have lived, what jobs you have held, background questions on your education, and personal risk factors such as smoking. You will receive $10 for your time to complete this survey. At that time we will confirm your address and send you a consent form for part two, which is the blood draw.  

### Part 2: Blood Draw
After we receive the consent form for the blood draw, someone from our office will contact you to set up an appointment.
- A phlebotomist (a healthcare worker trained in drawing blood) from Quest Diagnostics will make a one-time visit to your home or come to your workplace to collect a sample of your blood.
- The blood draw is paid for by the study, and there will be no cost to you or your insurance.
- This should not take more than 20 minutes of your time.
- You will receive $50 for your time for providing approximately 10 milliliters (two teaspoons) blood sample.
- Your blood sample will be labeled with a unique identification number instead of using your name or other personal information and sent to a lab for processing.

Your cooperation will further the work on finding the causes for ALS.  

*THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!*
