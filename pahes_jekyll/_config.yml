# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

title: Study for Environmental Risk Factors for ALS
email: ALSstudy@pitt.edu
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  The purpose of this research study is to look at possible risk factors for ALS,
  using information from the CDC National ALS Registry of individuals with ALS (cases)
  compared to a group of people without ALS (controls).  A risk factor is an exposure or
  characteristic that puts you at greater risk for disease, (e.g., cigarette smoking is a
  risk factor for lung cancer.) There are environmental, occupational, and personal risk
  factors which may be associated with an increased risk for ALS. We are exploring these
  risk factors in the hopes of identifying more about what causes this disease.
