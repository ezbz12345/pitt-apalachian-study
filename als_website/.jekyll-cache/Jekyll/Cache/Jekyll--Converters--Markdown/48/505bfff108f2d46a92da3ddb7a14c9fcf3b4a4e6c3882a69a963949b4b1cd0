If you have any questions, please contact us by email at <a href="ALSstudy@pitt.edu">ALSstudy@pitt.edu</a>, by phone at 412-648-5185, or mail our address located at the top and bottom of the web page.</p>

<h2 id="the-study-has-two-parts">The Study Has Two Parts</h2>

<h3 id="part-1-survey">Part 1: Survey</h3>
<p>You will be asked to participate in a 30-minute telephone or web-based interview consisting of questions about where you have lived, what jobs you have held, background questions on your education, and personal risk factors such as smoking. You will receive $10 for your time to complete this survey. At that time we will confirm your address and send you a consent form for part two, which is the blood draw.</p>

<h3 id="part-2-blood-draw">Part 2: Blood Draw</h3>
<p>After we receive the consent form for the blood draw, someone from our office will contact you to set up an appointment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A phlebotomist (a healthcare worker trained in drawing blood) from Quest Diagnostics will make a one-time visit to your home or come to your workplace to collect a sample of your blood.</li>
  <li>The blood draw is paid for by the study, and there will be no cost to you or your insurance.</li>
  <li>This should not take more than 20 minutes of your time.</li>
  <li>You will receive $50 for your time for providing approximately 10 milliliters (two teaspoons) blood sample.</li>
  <li>Your blood sample will be labeled with a unique identification number instead of using your name or other personal information and sent to a lab for processing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your cooperation will further the work on finding the causes for ALS.</p>

<p><em>THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!</em></p>
