I"W<p>The purpose of this research study is to look at possible risk factors for ALS, using information from the CDC National ALS Registry of individuals with ALS (cases) compared to a group of people without ALS (controls).  A risk factor is an exposure or characteristic that puts you at greater risk for disease, (e.g., cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer.) There are environmental, occupational, and personal risk factors which may be associated with an increased risk for ALS. We are exploring these risk factors in the hopes of identifying more about what causes this disease.</p>
